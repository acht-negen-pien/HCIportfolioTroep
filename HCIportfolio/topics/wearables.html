			<h3>Traffic Telepathy</h3>
			<p>When cycling in traffic, there are many distractions. People bike around on their phone, talk to a friend, are distracted by something they see on the streets, or many more things. This can lead to dangerous situations.</p>

			<p>Imagine that people that there was a wearable to help people focus on their surroundings. Imagine a bracelet that keeps track of where your focus lies, and gives you a quick reminder to watch where you’re going.</p>

			<p>The concept of this bracelet is that it measures your brainwaves and communicates with nearby bracelets so that it can let you know when another traffic-participant is coming your way who you might not have noticed. The bracelet communicates via vibrations and can let you know where the other person is coming from. Are they coming from the left, then the bracelets left side will vibrate. Are they coming from ahead, the top will vibrate, et cetera.</p>

			<p>As an additional feature, you can send nudges to the other person if they are still not aware of you coming their way. The bracelet measures that you’re getting worked up and will send a signal to the other person’s bracelet, which will start to vibrate more intensely.</p>


			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>I watched a talk by Golden Krishna about his book ‘The Best Interface Is No Interface’. He talks about how we are being consumed by screens on a daily basis and he wants to change that by replacing screens with different, screenless solutions.</p>

			<p>Microsoft is working on temporary interactive tattoos. They can be customized and shaped however the user wants. The goal of this technology is to create more sustainable mindset around wearable technology, since many wearables cost a lot of material and are abandoned after a couple of months of use.</p>

			<p>MIT is also working on smart tattoos, but in a different way. The smart ink is capable of tracking certain bodily functions, such as heartbeat, water level, and blood sugar. This project, the Dermal Abyss, can be very helpful in the medical field, for example in people with diabetes.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>I found Golden Krishna's talk very interesting. He talks about our lives being consumed by screens, notifications and pop up messages. He comes across as a bit condescending at times, a bit like your grumpy uncle who thinks that ‘kids these days’ are on their phone too much and are not spending any time in the ‘real world’. However, I think he has a point. Almost every app or social media platform is designed to grab the user’s attention and to make them use it for as long as possible. I’m a big fan of design solutions that don’t involve an app somehow, or smartphone apps that you can use without looking at the screen at all time.</p>

			<p>People being on their phones and not paying attention to their surroundings bothers me to no end. For example, when you’re trying to get on a train during rush hour and the person in front of you is too busy scrolling through instagram to watch their surroundings and move accordingly. It slows everything down. Cyclists who are on their phone bother me even more, because their lack of attention to traffic can cause dangerous situations. That’s why I came up with the wearable concept above. Now, of course phones are not the source of all evil when it comes to traffic, but the point is that people often don’t pay attention to the road and I wanted to solve that. </p>
