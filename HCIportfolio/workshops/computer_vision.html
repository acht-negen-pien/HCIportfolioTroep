			<h2>Processing</h2>
			<p>For this assignment, we returned to Processing. My class already had a processing course before, so all I needed was a quick refresher of the knowledge before I was on my way. We started with some basic exercises, like drawing shapes and lines and coloring them.</p>

			<p>Then, we got into the interesting stuff. We used libraries to expand the possibilities of Processing. Libraries are collections of code that extend the software beyond its core functions and classes. We used a facial recognition library that allowed us to track our faces in real time with the webcam.</p>

			<p>With some alteration of the code, I managed to make a black incognito bar that stays on the face. </p>

			<p>Then I opened up another library. This piece of code is able to recognize the brightest part of the realtime webcam image. I changed the code so that a little star appears at the brightest spot.</p>

			<p>Lastly, as a final demonstration of AR and computer vision, I opened up a library that can recognize a certain figure on screen and make a 3D cube appear on top of it.</p>
