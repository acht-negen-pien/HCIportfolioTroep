			<h3>Traffic Telepathy</h3>
			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>


			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>I watched a talk by Golden Krishna about his book ‘The Best Interface Is No Interface’. He talks about how we are being consumed by screens on a daily basis and he wants to change that by replacing screens with different, screenless solutions.</p>

			<p>Microsoft is working on temporary interactive tattoos. They can be customized and shaped however the user wants. The goal of this technology is to create more sustainable mindset around wearable technology, since many wearables cost a lot of material and are abandoned after a couple of months of use.</p>

			<p>MIT is also working on smart tattoos, but in a different way. The smart ink is capable of tracking certain bodily functions, such as heartbeat, water level, and blood sugar. This project, the Dermal Abyss, can be very helpful in the medical field, for example in people with diabetes.
