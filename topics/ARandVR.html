			<h2>Assignments</h2>
			<p>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality have great potential in all kinds of different fields. Below are concepts that I’ve come up with in three different areas of application</p>

			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>It is well known that information is retained better when paired with a visual. Especially in high school, when kids tend to zone out or play with their phones during class. Imagine that every student wears a VR headset that depicts whatever the teacher is talking about. You can turn history class into a Game of Thrones-like viewing party, or you could illustrate complicated homeostatic processes with an immersive animation in biology class. 
			</p>

			<h3>Sports</h3>
			<p>Yoga class too expensive? Don’t feel like leaving the house? Or do you just dislike interacting with people? Get a VR yoga instructor! Start up your VR goggles and enter a relaxing environment with a virtual yoga instructor. The environment can be entirely customizable to whatever you think is relaxing. This way you can enjoy private yoga lessons from the comfort of your home. 
			</p>

			<h3>Healthcare</h3>
			<p>Spending long amounts of time in the hospital can be very uncomfortable. Hospital rooms usually are no Ikea showrooms, either. With projection mapping, patients could change the way their rooms look in the blink of an eye, and it can be put away immediately if necessary. For example, you could project beautiful views from all around the world on the wall. This can help change combat boredom and suffering, especially when the patient is bedridden. 
			</p>


			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>When I was studying Applied Fine Art in Finland last year, I visited the exhibition Massless, displayed in Amos Rex. This exhibition was a collaboration with teamLab, an art collective consisting of artists, programmers, engineers, CG animators, mathematicians and architects. They are known for their breathtaking AR art installations. Here is their description of Massless:</p> 

			<p><i>The digital has liberated human expression from the physical. Expression no longer requires an irreversible bond to the material in order to exist, thus dissolving the notion of mass. Expression freed from physical constraints also makes our experience of artworks and space "Massless".</i></p>

			<p>What I found so impressive about these works is the great immersiveness and interactivity. The works are all around you. My favorite part was Graffiti Nature: Lost, Immersed, and Reborn. In this installation, the visitor gets to add an animal to the ecosystem by filling in a coloring page of the desired animal. The page is then scanned and the animal comes to life. It can multiply or be eaten. It is fascinating to see something come to life that you’ve just drawn, and to see it interact with other people’s creations.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
