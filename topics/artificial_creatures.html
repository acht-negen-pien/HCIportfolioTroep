			<h2>Assignment</h2>
			<p>In biology, homeostasis is the state of chemical balance inside a living creature. In creatures like ourselves, homeostasis is influenced by hormones, blood flow, consumption of food and many more factors that make sure that our bodies work like they are supposed to and we feel okay. However, the homeostasis model is not only reserved for organic beings of flesh and blood. Take for example a creature made of plastic, metal, bolts, and screws. Take, for example, a printer. They were designed to carry out a specific function that makes our lives easier, but we must help them maintain their own homeostasis. </p>

			<p>First and foremost, a printer needs power. Without power, printers will immediately pass out into a comatose state and cease to display any signs of life. There is no need to worry, since printers will wake up from a coma as soon as they are provided with a power supply. </p>

			<p>Once a printer is newly plugged in, it will be hungry. Most printers fare best on a diet of white A4 sheets of paper, but they will happily accept different colors as well. Some printers breeds will also eat different sizes or thicknesses of paper, but do make sure that your printer can handle these. Feeding a printer paper that it wasn’t designed to digest can mess up its internal organs. </p>

			<p>Now that the printers hunger has been satisfied, it will tell you it’s thirsty. A printer drinks exclusively ink, and it needs four colours to function optimally: black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. A printer is able to survive on black ink only, but it will lose its ability to print in color. </p>

			<p>As you build a connection with your printer, every now and then it will get hungry or thirsty again. Most printers will tell you when they need to be sustained, but some printers forget to do so or are a bit timid. In this case, you will have to read the signs for yourself. These signs can include: faded prints, black and white prints when you were expecting color, or an empty paper tray. If your printer is well fed and properly refreshed but it still doesn’t function as expected, it might be sick. Contact your local printer care center and talk to an experienced printer caretaker.

			<h2>Research</h2>

			<p>My research was pointed primarily towards the topic of affective computing. This topic grabbed my interest about a year ago, on a school trip to the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz. I was intrigued by an exhibition called “AI Kitty” by Pinar Yoldas. It was a twelve-minute long video about an AI governor that rules the EU and has the emotional intelligence of a cat. She is in our phones and knows all about us, but most importantly, she loves and takes care of us. The idea of replacing all human government with a loving and omniscient AI was so awesome to me, I would be completely on board with it.</p> 

			<p>Inspired by Kitty AI, I went to look for more information about affective computing. I came across MIT scholar Rosalind Picard, who wrote a paper on the subject. Before you can start to put emotion in computers, you must first define emotion in humans. Picard writes that research has shown that, contrary to what some believe, emotion plays an essential part in decision making. It is true that too much emotion can impede decision making, but we now know that too little emotion impedes decision making as well. Therefore, if we want to create a fully functioning AI with decision making skills, it must be able to “experience” emotion to a certain degree.</p> 

			<p>However, AI that can “experience” emotion are not the only type of AI within the field of affective computing. There are four different types: computer that express affect, computers that can perceive affect, those that can do both and those that can do neither. Right now, most computers fall into the last category. Picard makes an interesting point about computers that can perceive affect and coincidentally combines this with a topic that we discussed earlier in this course: wearables.</p>

			<p>Remember those mood rings that supposedly change color based on your mood when you wear them? Affective wearable computers could actually sense the mood you are in, and act as a better personal assistant than Siri or Alexa with this information. They could suggest activities that will calm you down when you’re angry, or suggest you stop at the flower shop when you’re feeling affectionate towards your partner. It could perhaps even link up with other user’s affective wearables, and tell you whether that compliment about your new shirt was sincere or not. </p>

			

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>Being a former biologist myself, I found this topic quite interesting. The idea of machines as living creatures that have needs sounds a bit strange at first, but the homeostasis model makes a lot of sense actually. Communicating needs is the first step towards 'feeling', in the broadest sense of the word. </p>

			<p>Science fiction movies and shows sometimes scare us off from artificial intelligence that is capable of expressing emotions. Take for example HAL from 2001: Space Odyssey, the M5 from Star Trek or A.M from I have no mouth and I must scream. Each of these computers end up killing large numbers of people out of negative emotions like anger or fear. Maybe we are not ready for computers to experience emotions, but the concept of computers perceiving emotion and acting on it is very interesting and could be quite useful.</p>
